# SuCraft

This repository contains the open-source code for SuCraft, a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) survival experience server that has been running for over 11 years with over 15,000 unique users.

The majority of code used on SuCraft is proprietary, due to its exclusive licensing in other software, servers or products, or for legacy reasons. Throughout the past 2 years, the smaller independent components of the codebase have been re-implemented to be released as open-source.

As this project has been developed for the Paper platform and knowledge of the development environment is not typically present among the server's userbase, contributions are not strongly expected but always highly appreciated: both in the form of feature suggestions or code modifications.

### Learning resources and technologies

This project is written in the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/), and is built on [Paper](https://papermc.io/), which is written in Java. It is recommended to have a good grasp of both languages to understand and modify this code.

Below are some effective video tutorial series for new learners of these languages who have an interest in creating Minecraft plugins:
